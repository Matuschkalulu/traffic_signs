Detection of Unrecognizable Traffic Signs

The idea was developed during a short car ride. During that ride
it appeared that quite a lot traffic signs were unrecognizable, which let to unvertanties about which max speed is allowed or who has priority at the crossing?
Comunities are responsible to access free view at the traffic signs to assure every driver's safety.

To attack this problem: This project aims to make a first step to improve that risk.

The project follows different goals

	1. Gathering and Creating a Dataset for Unrecognizable Traffic Signs
	2. Creating a "Binary-Classification" Model via CNN for unrecognizable an recognizable Traffic Signs
	3. Traffic Sign Detection in Videos and Classification
